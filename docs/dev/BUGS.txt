- drag on a note results in an infinite note.
- octave changes via midi change note value, not reflected in UI.

- ios: invalid state exception. (probably coming from trying to reset oscillators while attenuating old oscillators and stopping them at a certain time).
- long delay on touch devices before note sounds
